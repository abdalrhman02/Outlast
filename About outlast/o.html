                    The story talks about the secret Murkoff company that conducts illegal and horrific experiments on humans, and it is said that doctors want to find a drug for deep dreams.
                    And you will play the role of a freelance journalist who receives an anonymous message about the company and the sender asks him to come to photograph and reveal the criminal experiments of the world.

                <p>
                    But no one knows where the experiments will reach, what happens inside the abandoned company building, and what happened to the experiments' victims!?
